## API Integration

The application integrates with the following backend endpoints:

- `GET /api/contacts` - Fetch paginated contacts with search
- `POST /api/contacts` - Create a new contact
- `DELETE /api/contacts/:id` - Delete a contact
- `DELETE /api/contacts` - Bulk delete contacts
- `GET /api/contacts/:id` - Get contact details with call attempts
- `GET /api/calls/attempts` - Fetch paginated call attempts with filtering
- `GET /api/calls/attempts/:id` - Get call attempt details
- `POST /api/calls/initiate` - Initiate a call for contact(s)

## Mock Data Demo

The application includes comprehensive mock data to demonstrate all features without requiring a backend API. This includes:

- **12 Sample Contacts** with diverse names, phone numbers, and debt amounts
- **15 Call Attempts** with various statuses and outcomes
- **Realistic Data** including resolved payments, partial agreements, and failed attempts
- **Interactive Features** - Add new contacts, initiate calls, and see data updates in real-time

When using mock data, you'll see a "Demo Mode" badge in the header.

### Switching Between Mock and Real API

To use a real backend API, update your `.env` file:
```bash
# Disable mock data and use real API
VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA=false
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-server.com
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash

   ```
   
   **Note**: Environment variables in Vite must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be accessible in the browser.

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The application will start at `http://localhost:3000` with mock data enabled by default.
